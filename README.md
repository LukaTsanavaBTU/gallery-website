# Gallery Website

An image browsing website using React and Typescript, images are fetched from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers). By clicking the images, you can see the full picture and how many views, likes, downloads it has. Previous searches are saved in the cache and you can view them again in the history tab.<br/>You can try out the [live webpage here](https://lukatsanava-gallery.netlify.app/).

## What I Practiced While Working On This Project

- Using Typescript with React;
- Fetching and dynamically displaying data from an API;
- Caching previous API calls and displaying cached data;
- Using React Router to make multi-page websites.
